The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the `calc()` function with percentages and lengths in a way that is not fully supported by all browsers:  ```css div { width: calc(50% - 10px); } ``` This code intends to make a div 50% of its container's width minus 10 pixels.  The problem is that the calculation may not be handled consistently across browsers, especially in older browsers or those with less complete CSS support.  Some browsers might interpret this correctly while others might throw an error or render the div with unexpected dimensions.  A related problem can arise when combining different units within `calc()` in unsupported ways or with nested `calc()` functions. Inconsistent or incorrect rendering is often the result.
